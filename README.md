This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Using the package manager of your choice, install dependencies:

```bash
bun install # or (yarn|npm) install
(cd ios && bundle install)
(cd ios && bundle exec pod install)
```

## Step 2: Start Metro

Start Metro:

```bash
bun start # or (yarn|npm) start
```

## Step 3: Build and run the application

In a _new_ terminal, run the following:

### For iOS

```bash
bun ios

# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see the app running in your _iOS Simulator_ shortly.

## Step 4: Follow On-screen Instructions

The application, once loaded, has on-screen instructions to replicate the issue.
